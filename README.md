# Mixed Messages

## Overview
_Here's is my solution to the **CodeCademy's** [Mixed Messages Portfolio Project](https://www.codecademy.com/projects/portfolio/mixed-messages)._

Mixed Messages is a **message generator program**. Every time a user runs a program, they get a new, randomized output.

## Project Goals

 - Use your knoledge of **JavaScript**, **git version control** and the **command line**
 - The message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data
